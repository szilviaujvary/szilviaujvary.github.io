<left> <h1>About Me</h1> </left>

Hello and welcome to my website! I'm a first-year PhD student in the [ML@CL](https://mlatcl.github.io/) group at the University of Cambridge, supervised by [Dr. Ferenc Husz√°r](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/people/fh277). I'm interested in generalization, statistical learning theory and optimization.

I did an MPhil in Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence in Cambridge, where I worked on PAC-Bayes. Prior to that, I was an undergraduate in Mathematics at Imperial College London.

You can find my publications [here](./publications.md).
