<left> <h1>About Me</h1> </left>

Hello and welcome to my website! I'm a second-year PhD student in the [ML@CL](https://mlatcl.github.io/) group at the University of Cambridge, supervised by [Dr. Ferenc Huszár](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/people/fh277). 

My research focuses on explaining emergent abilities of LLMs, such as in‑context learning and out‑of‑distribution generalisation, as well as related foundational questions in (algorithmic) information theory. 

Previously, I did an MPhil in Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence in Cambridge, where I worked on PAC-Bayes and optimisation. Prior to that, I was an undergraduate in Mathematics at Imperial College London.

You can find my publications [here](./publications.md) or on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LknnfTQAAAAJ&hl=hu) page.
